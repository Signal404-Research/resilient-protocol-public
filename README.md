## 📡 MISSION STATEMENT
**Signal 404** is an open-source, decentralized research initiative operating on the "Resilient Protocol."

We utilize zero-capital computational pipelines—leveraging cloud computing, genetic algorithms, and fragment-based drug design—to generate high-fidelity therapeutic and diagnostic blueprints for neglected global health threats.

**All data, code, and molecular structures generated by this node are dedicated to the Public Domain (CC0).** We believe the cure should be as accessible as the disease.

## 🛠️ THE TECHNOLOGY STACK
We operate a "Zero-Lab" model. All discoveries are computational predictions generated via:
* **Genetic Algorithms:** Native Python implementation for DNA Aptamer evolution (AI-Assisted Code Generation).
* **RDKit / BRICS:** Primary engine for fragment-based small molecule assembly.
* **ChEMBL Integration:** Mining open-source inhibition data for target validation.
* **Experimental Pipelines:** Custom solutions for ad-hoc technical challenges. *Note: All candidates are currently In Silico predictions awaiting wet-lab synthesis.*

## ⚖️ CITATION & USAGE

The molecular structures and sequences contained herein are established as **Prior Art** to prevent restrictive patenting by third parties.

**You are free to:**
* Use these sequences in your lab.
